# Hangtight

So far, I've only managed to go over the website, to find minor ways that the website can be improved. It's mostly minor changes that would improve the overall feel of the website.

**NOTE**: I opened the website on Safari, and Brave. This behavior is consistent on both. 

#### Dark Mode
I'm sure this isn't a top priority, but I'd look into the possibility of adding dark mode support to the website.
I see that the mobile app supports Dark Mode, but the website doesn't. 
A little toggle button at the top of the page that would turn toggle dark mode would be appreciated. 
I love that transition to the Dark Mode section where everything is in dark mode. 

#### Buttons for app download

This is another minor detail. The text in the buttons for app download aren't centered. I'd make that change.


#### Navbar buttons

I'd improve the on-hover styling of the navbar buttons, making them pop a little more, removing the hyperlink styling they have at the moment.


#### The overlay of the phone

The screenshot extends to beyond the bounds of the phone overlay on scroll.

#### 'Meet Hangtight' text alignment

The "Meet Hangtight" text is not fully visible until you scroll to the end of the section.

I'd move the phone to the left, and have the "Meet Hangtight" to the right of the phone, with the words being under each other.

#### Missing images/icons

I believe the assets for the Payment Splitting, Calendar Linking, and Reservation Booking did not load. It could be a work in progress, or an issue linking them for scale.

#### Don't fall behind section

I like this section. The moving arrow on hover is a nice touch. It adds a little life to the button, which I appreciate.


#### The missing icon

The icon in the little orange square is missing. I'd add a little download arrow icon there.
Just like at the top of the page, the text in the buttons isn't centered, and the buttons are oversized. I'd add an Apple icon, and an Android icon next to the text.

<img width="580" alt="image" src="https://github.com/orangatun/hangtight-improvements/assets/34887793/7d4d46a2-69e0-404c-a7b8-ec8fd874ab5c">

There's a tiny grey rectangle at the top of the screenshot, which I believe can be cropped and is a tiny fix. It just stands out quite a bit. 

#### Inconsistency in navbar size

The navbar text is bigger on the home page, compared to the FAQ page, all while the navbar itself has the same content and is of the same size. 
The contact us page shows odd behavior, loading the navbar with a bigger font size, and decreasing the size a few seconds later.

#### Positioning of the icons and buttons
The icons on the *Contact Us* page, next to the form can use a little alignment.

#### Subject of the contact@hangtight.live email

<img width="608" alt="image" src="https://github.com/orangatun/hangtight-improvements/assets/34887793/e74c0d01-3c09-440e-848d-0405cb66e515">

The subject of the email is set to "Webflow Template Contact" which I believe was a placeholder in the Webflow template that was left in.



## Conclusion

These are mostly minor bugfixes that shouldn't take too long, but improving user experience, and accessibility should be a great way to take hangtight forward.
